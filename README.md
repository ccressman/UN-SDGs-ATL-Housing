*Project in Process/Incomplete* Evaluating whether absence of rent control measures in Atlanta, GA places undue financial burden on low-income populations


Background:
Acute economic volatility, catalyzed by the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has caused significant financial turmoil in the US. The goal of this analysis will be to isolate and evaluate these economic challenges in relation to the U.S. housing sector. Specifically, to quantify the possible negative impacts on low-income populations within the Atlanta MSA due to surging rent rates.


Framing the Issue:
Unlike some U.S. states, Georgia currently preempts rent control measures . This analysis will question whether the absence of such regulatory measures leads to unchecked negative social impacts under the weight of inflationary pressures. For instance, could these pressures lead to increased rates of homelessness, opportunistic gentrification, or another form of social injustice? If so, would regulation be effective in mitigating these failings? Answering such questions is central to ensuring the construction of the more inclusive, just, and resilient world required by tomorrow.
